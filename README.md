# Python3
This Repository will be used for storing python3 scripts and their tests(Not for all python3 scripts).

Script files are created for use on linux systems and thus the shebang line '#!/usr/bin/env python3' have been added.
To use the script files on other Operating Systems appropriate changes should be made in the shebang line.

if file with extension '.out' is found for a file, it represents the output file for the script file from pprofile3.
The output file will be in callgrind format and tool like "kcachegrind" can be used to see the contents appropriately.
